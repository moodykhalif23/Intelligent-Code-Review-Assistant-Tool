## Component Descriptions

### CLI Interface

The CLI interface is the main entry point for the application. It parses command-line arguments, loads configuration, and orchestrates the execution of the various components.

### Configuration Management

The configuration management component handles loading and validating configuration from files and command-line flags. It provides a unified configuration object that is used throughout the application.

### Repository Scanner

The repository scanner is responsible for finding and filtering files in a repository. It supports excluding directories and files based on patterns, and can be configured to include or exclude test files.

### Core Analysis

The core analysis component coordinates the execution of the various analysis components and aggregates their results. It manages concurrency and ensures that all files are properly analyzed.

### Analysis Components

#### Code Pattern Detection

The code pattern detection component identifies code smells and anti-patterns in the code. It uses Go's AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) parser to analyze the structure of the code and detect issues.

Key features:
- Detection of empty functions
- Identification of functions with too many parameters
- Analysis of function length and complexity
- Checking for undocumented exported functions
- Recognition of anti-patterns like singletons and large interfaces

#### Security Scanning

The security scanning component identifies security vulnerabilities in the code. It integrates with gosec for comprehensive security analysis and adds custom security rules.

Key features:
- Detection of hardcoded credentials
- Identification of command injection vulnerabilities
- Analysis of cryptographic implementations
- Checking for insecure cookie settings
- Recognition of unvalidated redirects

#### Optimization Suggestions

The optimization suggestions component identifies opportunities for performance improvements in the code. It analyzes the code for inefficient patterns and suggests optimizations.

Key features:
- Detection of inefficient string concatenation
- Identification of suboptimal slice capacity
- Analysis of map initialization
- Checking for inefficient regular expression usage
- Recognition of redundant type conversions

#### PR Summary Generation

The PR summary generation component creates concise summaries of pull requests. It analyzes the differences between two Git references and provides an overview of the changes.

Key features:
- Calculation of files changed, lines added, and lines deleted
- Identification of key changes like new files and interface modifications
- Analysis of affected areas in the codebase
- Detection of large changes that might need special attention

### Machine Learning

The machine learning component learns from feedback on previous suggestions to improve future recommendations. It collects data on which suggestions were accepted or rejected and adjusts confidence levels accordingly.

Key features:
- Data collection for learning
- Adjustment of issue confidence based on historical feedback
- Filtering and sorting of issues based on acceptance rates
- Analysis of project-specific patterns
- Suggestion of custom rules based on successful patterns

### Output Format

The output format component formats the analysis results for presentation to the user. It supports multiple output formats including text, JSON, and HTML.

## Data Flow

1. The CLI interface parses command-line arguments and loads configuration
2. The repository scanner finds and filters files in the repository
3. The core analysis component coordinates the analysis of the files
4. Each analysis component processes the files and generates results
5. The machine learning component adjusts and filters the results based on historical data
6. The output format component formats the results for presentation
7. The CLI interface presents the results to the user

## Extension Points

The architecture is designed to be easily extensible. Key extension points include:

- Adding new code pattern detectors
- Implementing custom security rules
- Creating new optimization suggestions
- Extending the machine learning component with new algorithms
- Adding new output formats

## Dependencies

The application has minimal external dependencies:

- Go standard library for most functionality
- gosec for security vulnerability scanning
- Git command-line tools for PR summary generation

## Performance Considerations

The application is designed to be performant even with large codebases:

- Concurrent analysis of files
- Efficient AST parsing and traversal
- Minimal memory footprint
- Optimized algorithms for pattern detection
